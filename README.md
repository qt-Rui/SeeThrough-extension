This is a chrome extension that will remove the promoted jobs that show up on LinkedIn. I have personally found it an annoyance that whenever I wish to look for a job position, I recieve tons of promoted jobs that contain an oversaturated amount of applicants, making it near impossible to be noticed. Using this extension, I want to be able to help users save their time looking through potential positions by filtering out the ones that are seen and interacted with the most. I will continue to expand on this, implementing improvements, and adding functionality by including websites like indeed in the near future. 


To give a clear picture of how benefical this can be, a LinkedIn job listing page contains up to 25 jobs. Each promoted job can hold hundreds and hundreds of applicants because they are the jobs shown and advertised the most to users on the website. As it stands now, from my own personal use with the extension, up to a maximum of 23 jobs are promoted on a single page when I search up jobs in my field. This will vary depending on the job that is searched for since it appears that some listings are more bloated with promoted jobs than others are, but overall, narrowing down the search to only those nonpromoted jobs will likely yield a better chance for success which is my ultimate goal with this extension.
