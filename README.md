This is a chrome extension that will remove the promoted jobs that show up on LinkedIn. I have personally found it an annoyance that whenever I wish to look for a job position, I recieve tons of promoted jobs that contain an oversaturated amount of applicants, making it near impossible to be noticed. Using this extension, I want to be able to help users save their time looking through potential positions by filtering out the ones that are seen and interacted with the most. I will continue to expand on this, implementing improvements, and adding functionality by including websites like indeed in the near future.
